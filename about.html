      <h1> hi, I'm michelle! </h2>
      <p> just a little about me:
        <br> I’m a fourth-year senior in HCDE.
        <br>I grew up in Surabaya, Indonesia and have been in Seattle for four years now and am loving every moment!
        <br> Since coming to Seattle, I’ve really enjoyed talking walks and exploring the beauty of the city!
        I love nature, parks, architecture, and generally being surrounded by beauty.
        But when it’s too cold and I have to stay indoors, I love journaling, knitting, reading, and getting to know people better.
        I also maintain a pretty strong caffeine addiction…..
