      <h1>MP-1 Write Up: Extensions</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>For this assignment, I started off by deciding what type of extension I would want to make
        by thinking about what type of extension I would personally find useful. I realized that I
        take a lot of notes when I'm looking at articles and websites, so I figured it could be helpful
        to create a little notes extension. At this point, I figured that the basic functionality I
        needed would just be the ability to jot down notes without having to open a notes app.

        /> -->
      </p>
      <h2>Issue</h2>
      <p>Setting up the extension HTML and getting to appear in my browser was actually very easy. Because of this,
        I definitely underestimated how long the rest of the task would take -- at this barebone code, I was not
        able to store the text that I inputted whenever the extension was closed.
        I had an issue finding where the text was being stored and how to access that text to store it into
        Chrome's storage system.
      </p>
      <!-- <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
      <p>I chose to do a very simple CSS transition - just making a hyperlink ease out into a different color when a mouse
        hovers over it.
        <br> I wanted to make something super simple and minimalistic that would show that it was clickable, while adding a slight transition to it.

      <h2>Ideas & Future</h2>
      <p> I have a few ideas of what I want to do to this site!
        <li>
          <ul>Make everything look aesthetically MUCH much better - better margins and spacing between everything, more graphics, etc</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul>Make the header throughout the entire site</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul>Add more fun CSS transitions and animations throughout the site </ul>
        </li>
        <li><ul>Some sort of user interaction</ul></li>
      </p>
