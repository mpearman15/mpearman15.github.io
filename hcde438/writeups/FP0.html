      <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <p> I am planning on creating a site that will create a garden visualization based on user's emotions and activities
          throughout the day, like a visualized diary entry.
      </p>
      <br><img width="250"
      src="../mp/fp0/photos/photo1.jpeg"
      />
      <br>
      <h2>Prototype Version</h2>
      <p> Here are the main functions that I desire for this site:
        <li>
          <ul> Display a page of flowers that stretch across the page, corresponding to the days in a month </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul> Have a pop-up page that shows the different features that users can log into their diary </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul> Have user input that will add to their garden in a minimal way </ul>
        </li>
      </p>
      <h2> Final Version </h2>
      <p> For the final project, I want to add in certain aspects of the project:
        <li>
          <ul> Making different graphics that correspond to different emotions and activities in the day (leaves, colors, flower type, length) </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul> Having user authentication so that different users can secure their information and store data on the page </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul> Connecting a time and date API to display time / data when people log in entries</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul> A CSS layout that has the same branding and layout throughout everything: probably something with an earthy, floral theme </ul>
        </li>
      </p>
      <h2> Development Plan </h2>
        <li>
          <ol> 3/2 - Create the prototype, and connect a firebase account to it for user input </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ol> 3/3 - Make user input correspond to graphics appearing on the page based on the type of input (key words)</ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ol> 3/5 - Create the CSS, HTML, and JS functionality of the main page and pop-up page </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ol> 3/7 - Submit Prototype Version </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ol> 3/10 - Create OAuth for users to log into their account </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ol> 3/12 - Finish up and finalize graphics </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ol> 3/13 - Connect a time and date API to correspond to user input for specific dates and times </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ol> 3/15 - Finalize branding overall </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ol> 3/17 - Submit Final Version </ol>
        </li>
      </p>
      <h2> Known Unknowns </h2>
        <li>
          <ul> How to connect the APIs to correspond to the current date and time and placing the flowers in the right place based on that </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul> Uncertain about specifics with using Firebase and authentication (but I did watch the walk-throughs so hopefully it's okay) </ul>
        </li>
      <h2> Stretch Goals </h2>
        <li>
          <ul> Connecting a weather API as well to display the weather for each day </ul>
        </li>
