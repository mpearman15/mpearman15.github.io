      <h1>Final Project Prototype</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p> For the final project, I wanted to create a visualized diary entry site, that would have a garden visualization based on user's emotions and activities
        throughout the day. However, for this prototype, I kept it very simple and only had functionality that demonstrated
        what it would be like to click to add a new entry to the page, and then be able to click on the screen to "plant"
        whatever entry they just entered in, and having the data they entered sent to firebase.
      </p>
      <h2>Project Scope</h2>
      <p> After beginning to create my prototype, the scope changed a little. I had wanted to have a large variety of different graphics and animations
        (leaves, colors, flower type, length), but now that I have started the project, I am realizing that I may not have the time to make so many different types,
        or to correlate the graphics to a specific spot on the screen. Instead, I was thinking of just having different flowers appear on the page, and then
        having the ability to hover over them to show what they said.
      </p>
      <h2>Time management</h2>
      <p> Setting up and figuring out how to use firebase and connect all the components together took a lot longer than I expected. As a result,
        I was not able to get all of the components that I had initially wanted for this prototype.
      </p>
      <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
      <p> I will definitely be starting as soon as possible for the final, and prioritize the main functionality over some of the other features.
        Also, given the problems I have had using vite, P5.js, and firebase all together, I will need to deploy more often to be able to troubleshoot more often.
      </p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p> The first thing I did was set up vite, and try to connect firebase to it. This was a challenge because it was a new platform and I had a hard time
        understanding all of the different keywords and how to access different type of information.
        After setting up firebase, I created very basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript functionality for the page. I made a button that leads to a popup screen that has different
        diary entry options.
        <br><img width="250"
        src="../mp/fp1/photos/photo1.png"
        />
        <br><img width="250"
        src="../mp/fp1/photos/photo2.png"
        />
        Also, something else that was difficult was figuring out the format to take in information from the user. After talking to Hannah, I set up
        an HTML form, put this information into an array, and then sent out this information to firestore. Thankfully through this process, it worked!
        <br>
        However, this isn't where the challenges ended. Although I was able to send information over to firestore, I wasn't able to get that information
          back to utilize in the HTML page that I created. I followed the tutorial that had a similar functionality of receiving all the entries posted, but didn't
          receive anything. For this prototype, I decided to put this portion of the project on hold, and instead focus on what would happen next for the user after
          any given entry.
        <br> I did this by starting to incorporate p5.js. It was difficult because I didn't want the canvas to just start going off immediately, so I put the p5 code into
        the function that is called whenever users create a new entry. I had to learn a new syntax format for this to work for me, but after I learned that it worked well.
        <br> I decided to have users "plant" their entry by being able to place it somewhere on the screen by clicking onto a space whenever they submit an entry.
        <br><img width="250"
        src="../mp/fp1/photos/photo3.png"
        />
        <br> One problem that this presented, however, was that users could just keep on stamping / "planting" their entry whenever they clicked.
      </p>
      <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
      <p> For the final project, I will be focusing on how to get firebase information back to be utilized on the page. I will also finalize whether I want the different
        entries to be in a chronological format, or something that users can place on their own. I could see the benefit of doing either way! Finally, I will be adding more
        questions into the entry pop-up, and then making the CSS pretty.
      </p>

      <h2>Kudos</h2>
      <p> Kudos to Hannah for helping me!
