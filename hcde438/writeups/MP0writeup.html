      <h1>MP-0 Write Up</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>For this assignment, I started off by making a list of all the different components I would need
        and sketched out a rough draft of what the website would eventually look like.
        <br> Then, I looked at the example on this class' github to copy over the structure of the HTML file
        and any other relevant code.
        Here is an example of my "About Page":
        <br>
        <br><img
        class="large-picture"
        src="/photos/MP0-writeup.png"
        />
      </p>
      <h2>Issue</h2>
      <p>I had trouble setting up my site initially, which was super frustrating because I knew that I had
        used the same site a year ago when I took HCDE 439. Silly enough, the problem was that my personal
        access token needed to be regenerated, and that's why it wasn't working.
      </p>
      <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
      <p>I chose to do a very simple CSS transition - just making a hyperlink ease out into a different color when a mouse
        hovers over it.
        <br> I wanted to make something super simple and minimalistic that would show that it was clickable, while adding a slight transition to it.
        <br>
        <br><img
        class="large-picture"
        src="/video-documentation/MP0-transition.gif"
        />
      </p>
      <h2>Ideas & Future</h2>
      <!-- <p> I have a few ideas of what I want to do to this site!
        <li>
          <ul>Make everything look aesthetically MUCH much better - better margins and spacing between everything, more graphics, etc</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul>Make the header throughout the entire site</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul>Add more fun CSS transitions and animations throughout the site </ul>
        </li>
        <li><ul>Some sort of user interaction</ul></li>
      </p> -->
