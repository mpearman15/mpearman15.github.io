            <p>
                This is what my circuit set up looked like. I wanted to make it as clean as possible so that I wouldn't get confused with all of the wires mixed up.

            </p>
            <p>
                And this is what it looked like in my schematic drawing:
                <br><img src="ass1_schem.jpg" width=400></a> </br>
                I used the same resistors, 220 Ohm, across each LED and ensured that the resistance was larger than the minimum amount. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to make it blink to the rhythm of the first 6 notes of "Doe a Deer" from the Sound of Music! 
                <br><img src="ass1.gif" width=400></a> </br>
                I had it set up in that way using an Array and a For loop. The Arduino code is below:
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>
        //stored pin numbers within variables so that it's easier to remember which color is corresponded to which pin number
        int blue = 12;
        int yellow = 11;
        int red = 13; 

        // the pattern in the Array below is meant to imitate the first 6 notes of "Doe a Deer" from the Sound of Musical
        int melody[] =  {
        blue, yellow, red, blue, red, blue, red 
        };
        int size = 6;
        int time = 500; // delay for 0.5 seconds for each LED to stay lit up     

        void setup() {
            pinMode(blue, OUTPUT); // initializing the Blue LED as an output
            pinMode(yellow, OUTPUT); //initializing the Yellow LED as an output
            pinMode(red, OUTPUT); // initializing the Red LED as an output 
            }

        void loop() {
            for (int i = 0; i <= size; i++) {
                digitalWrite(melody[i], HIGH); // turn the LED on by making the voltage HIGH
                delay(time); // waiting for set period of milliseconds
                digitalWrite(melody[i], LOW);  // turn off the LED by making the voltage LOW
            }
        }
            </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        
    </body>
