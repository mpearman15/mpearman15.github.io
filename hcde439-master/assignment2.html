            <h1>Michelle's Assignment 2!</h1>
            <p>
                This is what my circuit and schematic looked like for this assignment. I wanted to create a sequence of LEDs going from Red, fading to Blue, going back to Magenta, and then adding some green at the ends. 
            <img src="HCDE 439 A2 - Fade.pdf" width=1000></a>
            <br>These are the calculations for everything. I used a 220 Ohm resistors to stay consistent and used a 10k Ohm resistor for the button to allow it to have the little amperes required for it to be used. </br>

            The arduino code is below:

            <pre>
                <code>
        

const int button = 2;     //push button input 

const int green_LED = 7; //green LED
const int R = 12; //red for the RBG LED
const int G = 11; //green for the RBG LED
const int B = 10; //blue for the RBG LED  
const int red_LED = 9; //red LED
const int blue_LED = 13; // blue lED     

const int fadingDelay = 30;  //delay in microseconds


int buttonState = 0;     // initial state of button


void setup() {
  //initializing all of the LEDs and push button
  pinMode(green_LED, OUTPUT); 
  pinMode(red_LED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(blue_LED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(R, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(G, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(B, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(button, INPUT);
}

void loop() {

  buttonState = digitalRead(button); //read the button state and store it in buttonState

  if (buttonState == HIGH) { //if buttonState is HIGH, which happens when it is pressed
      for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i+= 5) { // for loop from 0 to 255 and incrementing 5 to increase RED LED brightness
        analogWrite(red_LED, i); //set the red LED to i
        delay(fadingDelay); //delay amount
      }
      for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i += 5) { //for loop from 0 to 255 and increment 5 to vary the RGB LED from red-ish to blue
        analogWrite(R, 255 - i); //Red starts off at 255 and decreases 5 every iteration
        analogWrite(B, i); //Blue starts at 0, and increases 5 every iteration
        delay(fadingDelay); // delay amount
      }
      for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i+= 5) { //for loop from 0 to 255 to increase BLUE LED brightness
        analogWrite(blue_LED, i); //set the blue LED to i
        delay(fadingDelay); //delay amount 
      }
      for (int i = 255; i >= 0; i -= 5) { //for loop from 0 to 255 to vary the RGB LED frin white to magenta
        analogWrite(R, 255); //R LED is constant at 255
        analogWrite(G, i); //Green LED starts at i and increments 5
        analogWrite(B, 255); // B LED is constant at 255
        delay(fadingDelay); //delay amount
      }
      digitalWrite(green_LED, HIGH); //turn Green LEDs on after all for loops have looped
  }
 
}    
                </code>
            </pre>

            This is the final product! The colors are a little hard to see on camera :/
