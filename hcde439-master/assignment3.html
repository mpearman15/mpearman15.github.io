            <h1>Michelle's Assignment 3!</h1>
            <p>
                As someone who drinks a lot of coffee, I've often had a problem with drinking it at the right temperature and not burning my tongue. So I decided to use a thermistor and an LED to give an indication of when the coffee is cool enough to drink. 
                I used Red to indicate being too hot, Green to indiciate the perfect temperature, and Blue to indicate too cold. 
                <br>Here is the schematics of this circuit board. </br>
                To convert from voltage and resistance to a temperature, I used Steinhartâ€“Hart's equation and used variables from this <a href="https://www.circuitbasics.com/arduino-thermistor-temperature-sensor-tutorial/">example:</a>
            <img src="A3_schematic.jpg" width=1000></a>
            <br>I used 220 Ohm resistors for the RGB LED and used a 10k Ohm resistor as a fixed resistor, in series with the thermistor. </br> 
        </p> 
            <p>
            The arduino code is below:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    // pin for red in the RBG LED
                    const int R = 12; 
                    // pin for green in the RBG LED
                    const int G = 11;
                    // pin for blue in the RBG LED 
                    const int B = 10; 
                    // pin for the thermistor
                    const int thermPin = A0; 
                    // lower temperature limit for the ideal temperature to drink
                    const int lowerTemp = 80; 
                    // upper temperature limit for the ideal temperature to drink 
                    const int upperTemp = 100; 
                    // known resistance amount connected to thermistor
                    const int R1 = 10000; 
                    // variables for converting resistance to temperature using the Steinhart-Hart equation. I got these numbers from an online example. 
                    float c1 = 1.009249522e-03, c2 = 2.378405444e-04, c3 = 2.019202697e-07;
                    
                    void setup() {
                      // setting the pins to OUTPUT and INPUT depending on their usage. 
                      pinMode(R, OUTPUT);
                      pinMode(G, OUTPUT);
                      pinMode(B, OUTPUT);
                      pinMode(thermPin, INPUT);
                      Serial.begin(9600);
                    
                    }
                    
                    void loop() {
                      // setting V0 as the variable to hold the information from reading thermPin, ie. the thermistor.
                      // Reading will be in voltage, ranging between 0 and 1023.
                      int V0 = analogRead(thermPin);
                      // calculations done to calculate R2, the resistance that corresponds to the voltage. 
                      float R2 = R1 * ((1023.0 / (float)V0) - 1.0);
                      // converting R2 into a logarithm
                      float logR2 = log(R2);
                      // calculating Temperature (T) using the Steinhart-Hart equation
                      float T = (1.0 / (c1 + c2*logR2 + c3*logR2*logR2*logR2));
                      T = T - 273.15;
                      // converting Kelvin to Fahrenheit
                      T = (T * 9.0)/ 5.0 + 32.0; 
                      // printing the temperature results into Serial
                      Serial.print("Temperature:");
                      Serial.print(T);
                      Serial.print(" F --> ");
                    
                      // temperature between 80 and 100 mapped out and converted into a 0 - 255 scale for luminosity use.
                      // as the ideal temperature decreases, the brightness will also decrease, letting users know to drink quickly
                      int desiredTemp = map(T, 80, 100, 0, 255);
                    
                      // if T is higher than the upper bound for ideal temperature, LED should be Red
                      if (T > upperTemp) {
                        analogWrite(R, 255);
                        analogWrite(G, 0); // set Green LED to 0
                        analogWrite(B, 0); // set Blue LED to 0
                        Serial.println("Don't drink - still too hot!"); // message output to tell users it's too hot
                      // if T is in the perfect range, light should be Green
                      } else if (T >= lowerTemp and T <= upperTemp) {
                        analogWrite(G, desiredTemp); // Green LED's brightness will continue to decrease as the desired temperature decreases
                        analogWrite(R, 0); // set Red LED to 0
                        analogWrite(B, 0); // set Blue LED to 0
                        Serial.println("Perfect temperature! Drink now!"); // message output to tell users it's the perfect temperature
                        // if T is lower than the lower bound of the ideal temperature, LED should turn Blue
                      } else if (T < lowerTemp) {
                        analogWrite(B, 255);
                        analogWrite(G, 0); // set Green LED to 0
                        analogWrite(R, 0); // set Red LED to 0
                        Serial.println("A little cold now. Maybe microwave it?"); // message output to tell users it's too cold
                      }
                      delay(2000); // delay 2 seconds in between each reading
                    }  
                </code>

            <br> This is the final product. In this first video, I move the sensor from a hot cup to a warmer cup to show how the sensor changes from red to green when it's too hot to a good temperature. </br>

            <br>This video shows the drink becoming warm enough to drink, going from red to green! </br>

            <br> And this is the output on the serial monitor: </br>
